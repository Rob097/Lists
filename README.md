# Lists
This is a project work of [Webprogramming]( https://sites.google.com/site/webprogramming18/), a course of the DISI (Unitn).

## How it works
The project is a website that helps you to do your shopping. In particular you can create custom shopping lists that you can share with other people or use already made lists. The site is designed in responsive mode so you can use it on PC, Tablet or Smartphone.
The main functions of the application are:
- chat with people with whom you have a shared list
- receive a notification from the system if a product needs to be bought as soon as possible
- receive a notification from the system if you are close to a store that can sell products on the lists.

If you want to use the application we recommend you register so you will be able to try all the features, otherwise you can try to make a list and register later.
